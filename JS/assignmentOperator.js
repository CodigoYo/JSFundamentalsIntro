/**Equal to (=) is an assignment operator, which sets the variable on the left of the = to the value of the expression that is on its right. This operator assigns lvalue to rvalue*/

/** = in JavaScript
 * = JavaScript operator assigns a value to the left operand depends on the value of operand available on the right side. The first operand should be a variable.

 The basic assignment operator is =, that assigns the value of one operand to another. That is, a = b assigns the value of b to a.

/** == in JavaScript
 * Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison
 * So, when you compare string with a number, JavaScript converts any string to a number. An empty string is always converts to zero. A string with no numeric value is converts to NaN (Not a Number), which returns false.
 */


/** === in JavaScript
 * The == operator is an equality operator. It checks whether its two operands are the same or not by changing expression from one data type to others. You can use == operator in order to compare the identity of two operands even though, they are not of a similar type.

 How === Works Exactly?
1) Strict equality === checks that two values are the same or not.
2) Value are not implicitly converted to some other value before comparison.
3) If the variable values are of different types, then the values are considered as unequal.
4) If the variable are of the same type, are not numeric, and have the same value, they are considered as equal.
5) Lastly, If both variable values are numbers, they are considered equal if both are not NaN (Not a Number) and are the same value.



 KEY DIFFERENCES:
 = is used for assigning values to a variable, == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.



 = is called as assignment operator, == is called as comparison operator whereas It is also called as comparison operator.



 = does not return true or false, == Return true only if the two operands are equal while === returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.
